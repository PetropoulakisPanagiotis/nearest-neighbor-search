Available methods: 
* Locality-sensitive hashing(lsh): 
* Hypercube:
* Exhuastive search
Available metrices: euclidean and cosine

# Requirements
* Compiler: g++ - C11 standard

# Installation
* Clone this repo to your local machine: 
```
git clone https://github.com/PetropoulakisPanagiotis/neighbors-problem.git
```
# Tutorial
* This repository contains a [tutorial](https://github.com/PetropoulakisPanagiotis/neighbors-problem/tree/master/tutorial) for newcomers.

# How It Works
* Lsh: Each model stores the data points in L hash tables. Every new query is hashed and is <br />  compared with the data of one specific bucket.
* Hypercube: Each model stores the data points in a hypercube structure(vector). Every new query is hashed and is <br /> compared with the data of one or more(neighbor vertices) vertices.
