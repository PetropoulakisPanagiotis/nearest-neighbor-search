Available methods: 
* Locality-sensitive hashing(lsh)
* Hypercube
* Exhuastive search
Available metrices: euclidean and cosine
</p>
# Requirements
* Compiler: g++ - C11 standard

# Installation
* Clone this repo to your local machine: 
```
git clone https://github.com/PetropoulakisPanagiotis/neighbors-problem.git
```
# Tutorial
* This repository contains a [tutorial](https://github.com/PetropoulakisPanagiotis/neighbors-problem/tree/master/tutorial) for the newcomers

# How It Works
* Lsh: Each model stores the data points in L hash tables. Every new query is hashed and is <br />  compared with the data of one specific bucket
* Hypercube: Each model stores the data points in a hypercube structure(vector). Every new query is hashed and is <br /> compared with the data of one or more(neighbor vertices) vertices

## Hash functions: Lsh Euclidean

# The hyperparameters
* L(lsh): Number of hash tables
* K: Number of sub hash functions
* W(euclidean): Window size. The value depends on the anticipate distance from the nearest neighbor
* Coefficient(euclidean lsh): Defines the table size of each hash table. Table size = n(number of data points) * coefficient(< 1)
