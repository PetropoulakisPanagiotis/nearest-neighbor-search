Available methods: 
* Lsh Euclidean / Cosine
* Hypercube Euclidena / Cosine
* Exhuastive search

# How It Works
* Lsh: Each model stores the data points in L hash tables. Every new query is hashed and it is <br />  compared with the data of one specific bucket 
* Hypercube: Each model stores the data points in a hypercube. Every new query is hashed and it is <br /> compared with the data of one or more(neighbor vertices) vertices.
